  abstract = {The resultant theory plays a crucial role in computational algebra and algebraic geometry. The theory has two aspects: algebraic and geometric. In this paper, we focus on the algebraic aspect. One of the most important and well known algebraic properties of the resultant is that it is equal to the determinant of the Sylvester matrix. In 2008, Odagiri proved that a similar property holds over the tropical semiring if one replaces subtraction with addition. The tropical semiring belongs to a large family of algebraic structures called commutative idempotent semiring. In this paper, we prove that the same property (with subtraction replaced with addition) holds over an arbitrary commutative idempotent semiring.}

  abstract = {The image of a linear space under inversion of some coordinates
  is an affine variety whose structure is governed by an underlying hyperplane arrangement. 
  In this paper, we generalize work by Proudfoot and Speyer to show that circuit polynomials
  form a universal Gröbner basis for the ideal of polynomials vanishing on this variety.
  The proof relies on degenerations to the Stanley–Reisner ideal of a simplicial complex determined by the underlying matroid, which is closely related to the external activity complex defined by Ardila and Boocher. If the linear space is real, then the semi-inverted linear space is also an example of a hyperbolic variety, meaning that all of its intersection points with a large family of linear spaces are real.}

  abstract = {We study probability density functions that are log-concave. Despite the space of all such densities being infinite-dimensional, the maximum likelihood estimate is the exponential of a piecewise linear function determined by finitely many quantities, namely the function values, or heights, at the data points. We explore in what sense exact solutions to this problem are possible. First, we show that the heights given by the maximum likelihood estimate are generically transcendental. For a cell in one dimension, the maximum likelihood estimator is expressed in closed form using the generalized W-Lambert function. Even more, we show that finding the log-concave maximum likelihood estimate is equivalent to solving a collection of polynomial-exponential systems of a special form. Even in the case of two equations, very little is known about solutions to these systems. As an alternative, we use Smale's α-theory to refine approximate numerical solutions and to certify solutions to log-concave density estimation.}

  abstract = {We study the univariate moment problem of piecewise-constant density functions on the interval [0,1] and its consequences for an inference problem in population genetics. We show that, up to closure, any collection of n moments is achieved by a step function with at most n −{\thinspace}1 breakpoints and that this bound is tight. We use this to show that any point in the n th coalescence manifold in population genetics can be attained by a piecewise constant population history with at most n −{\thinspace}2 changes. Both the moment cones and the coalescence manifold are projected spectrahedra and we describe the problem of finding a nearest point on them as a semidefinite program.},
