I am currently a postdoc at <a href='https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en'>Sorbonne Universit√©</a>, jointly in the <a href='https://www-polsys.lip6.fr/'>Polsys</a> team and at the <a href='https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/'>Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions</a>.
I completed my PhD in Mathematics under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.math.washington.edu/~vinzant/'>Dr. Cynthia Vinzant</a> in May 2021. 

My primary work involves studying mathematical structures that emerge within areas of the sciences and engineering.
A central motivation in my research is to combine symbolic and numerical methods in a best of both worlds approach, in order to enhance methods in optimization and statistical analysis which can be leveraged in various interdisciplinary settings.
