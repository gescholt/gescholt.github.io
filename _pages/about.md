I am currently a postdoc at [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), jointly in the [Polsys](https://www-polsys.lip6.fr/) team and at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/).
I completed my PhD in Mathematics under the supervision of [Dr. Cynthia Vinzant](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~vinzant/) in May 2021.

My primary work involves studying mathematical structures that emerge within areas of the sciences and engineering.
A central motivation in my research is to combine symbolic and numerical methods in a best of both worlds approach, in order to enhance methods in optimization and statistical analysis which can be leveraged in various interdisciplinary settings.
