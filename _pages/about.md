I am currently a postdoc at <a href='https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en'>Sorbonne Universit√©</a>, as a member of the <a href='https://www-polsys.lip6.fr/'>Polsys</a> team. My email address is [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).


<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
