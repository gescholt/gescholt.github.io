I am currently a postdoc in the [Algebraic Systems Biology group](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/researchgroups/currentgroups/heather-harrington/research-focus) at the [Center for Systems Biology Dresden](https://www.csbdresden.de/). I completed my PhD in Mathematics under the supervision of [Dr. Cynthia Vinzant](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~vinzant/) in May 2021.
Prior to this, I was a postdoc at [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), jointly in the [Polsys](https://www-polsys.lip6.fr/) team and at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/).
