I am currently at the [Center for Systems Biology Dresden](https://www.csbdresden.de/), where I am a postdoctoral researcher part of the [Harrington Group](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/researchgroups/currentgroups/heather-harrington/group).
Previously, I was a postdoc at [Sorbonne Universit√©](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), jointly in the [Polsys](https://www-polsys.lip6.fr/) team and at the [Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/).
I completed my PhD in Mathematics under the supervision of [Dr. Cynthia Vinzant](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~vinzant/) in May 2021.

My primary work involves studying mathematical structures that emerge from the study of dynamic and biological systems.
A central motivation in my research is to combine symbolic and numerical methods in a best of both worlds approach, in order to enhance methods in optimization and statistical analysis which can be leveraged in various interdisciplinary settings.

    Level sets of the Trefethen 3d function:
